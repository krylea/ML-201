# Machine Learning 201: Tips and Tricks
I have been spending the past year on what has effectively been an ongoing machine learning crash course. I started last september with an extremely minimal knowledge of machine learning, and was immediately thrust into a number of projects involving Natural Language Processing (or NLP) models making use of complicated Recurrent Neural Network architectures. At the time, this felt overwhelming and extremely stressful, but as I look back I realize it was a blessing in disguise. What I have found is that many of the existing resources for learning how to actually *do* machine learning - e.g. classes, blog posts, MOOCs - share a number of common failures. In my experience, the best - in fact, the *only* - place to really learn a lot of the critical information you need to know in order to really know how to really make deep learning models work to their full potential is other people who are already doing it. There are just so many things that I've needed to know that I have never found on a blog post or in course lecture notes. This project is an attempt to collect some of those tips and tricks from other people who are "in the biz", and create the resource that I wish I had when I was learning all this.
